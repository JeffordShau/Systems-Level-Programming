# Broad Description of the Project
Music Player:

Our project provides the user with a variety of songs through which they can use arrow keys to select. Once they select a song, the audio file associated with the song starts playing. Then, the user can choose to exit the song early (by pressing ctrl + c) or wait until the end of the song when they will be asked if they want to play a different song or if they would prefer to exit the program (by pressing x + enter).
